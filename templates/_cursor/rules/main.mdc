# AI Kit

On first interaction with a new task, read `AGENTS.md` in the project root.
If present, read `.cursor/rules/app-context.mdc` for a minimal app snapshot.
After hydration, run `/hydrate-verify` to confirm files, config, and placeholders.

It contains:

- Documentation Index (keyword → doc file mapping)
- Architecture quick reference
- Intelligent Dissent Protocol (when to suggest modern improvements)
- Critical anti-patterns to avoid

For file-specific patterns, see the other `.mdc` files in this folder—they auto-load based on file type.

## Commands

Use native Cursor commands (type `/` in chat) for common workflows:

- `/plan` - Architectural blueprint before coding
- `/build` - Production-ready implementation
- `/verify` - Code review and safety check
- `/hydrate-verify` - Hydration verification (files + config + placeholders)
- `/fix` - Quick targeted correction
- `/debug` - Root cause analysis
- `/refactor` - Improve code quality
- `/commit` - Create git commit
- `/discuss` - Technical debate
- `/explain` - Code walkthrough

Commands are defined in `.cursor/commands/` (not included in `--zero-config`) and load only when invoked.

## Documentation Policy

**DO NOT** update documentation in real-time during feature development. This creates noise, merge conflicts, and token waste.

**Instead:** Use the batch update workflow.

**When making significant changes** (new exports, breaking changes, new patterns), add a marker comment:

```typescript
// @docs-update(2024-01-15): path/to/DOCS.md - Description of change
```

Markers are the default for doc-worthy changes; keep 1–3 per commit. Manual shortcut: `docs-upd`.

Remember: You may challenge documented patterns when you find more secure, performant, or modern solutions. Present alternatives, explain tradeoffs, and ask permission before diverging.
